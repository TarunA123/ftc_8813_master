How to use Git for FTC

1. Setting up the repository

This will show how to set up the Git repository. First, you will need to create a GitHub account by
going to
  https://github.com/
and creating an account.

1.1 - Forking the main repo

    To make a copy of the team Git repository, first open a new browser tab and go to:
  https://github.com/cdbbnnyCode/ftc_8813_master
There, in the upper right corner there is a 'fork' button. Click on that and then follow the
instructions to fork the repository.

1.2 - Cloning the repository onto your computer

    To get your code onto your computer, you need to clone the fork you just made. To do this, open
a terminal and put:
//Quick note: The dollar signs are just a prompt. Don't actually put them into your command.
Go to your home directory
  $ cd ~
Clone the repo onto your computer
  $ git clone https://github.com/<GitHub username>/ftc_8813_master
Enter the repository folder
  $ cd ftc_8813_master

1.3 - Setting your Git username/email

Add your info to the Git configuration file
  $ git config --global user.name '<GitHub username>'
  $ git config --global user.email '<GitHub login e-mail>'
This will make any commits you push onto GitHub show up in your profile statistics and also makes it
so that it can log who made a commit in a repository.

2. Committing your code

    Committing your code is an important part of the Git workflow. When you commit a change, it is
saved in the repository and you can revert back to it (e.g. if you made a really nasty bug and don't
know why).

How to commit your code:

     Using Android Studio:                           Using the terminal
1. Go to VCS --> Commit Changes...               $ git commit -m "descriptive commit message"
2. Make a descriptive commit message
3. Click 'Commit'

3. Pushing your code to GitHub

    Pushing your commits to your GitHub repository is also very important. Just about nothing in Git
is automatically synced, so this is the way to do it manually. Pushing your code will send the
changes to the GitHub repository so you can then submit a Pull Request to get your code merged into
the main repository.

How to push your code:
