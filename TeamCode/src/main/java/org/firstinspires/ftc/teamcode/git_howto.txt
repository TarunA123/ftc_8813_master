1. Setting up the repository

This will show how to set up your Git repository. First, you will need to create a GitHub account by
going to
  https://github.com/
and creating an account.

1.1 - Forking the main repo

    To make a copy of the team Git repository, first open a new browser tab and go to:
  https://github.com/cdbbnnyCode/ftc_8813_master
There, in the upper right corner there is a 'fork' button. Click on that and then follow the
instructions to fork the repository.

1.2 - Cloning the repository onto your computer

    To get your code onto your computer, you need to clone the fork you just made. To do this, open
a terminal and put:
//Quick note: The dollar signs are just a prompt. Don't actually put them into your command.
Go to your home directory
  $ cd ~
Clone the repo onto your computer
  $ git clone https://github.com/<GitHub username>/ftc_8813_master
Enter the repository folder
  $ cd ftc_8813_master

1.3 - Setting your Git username/email

Add your info to the Git configuration file
  $ git config --global user.name '<GitHub username>'
  $ git config --global user.email '<GitHub login e-mail>'
This will make any commits you push onto GitHub show up in your profile statistics and also makes it
so that it can log who made a commit in a repository.

1.4 - Setting the upstream repository

    The 'upstream' repository is the one you forked from. It is important to have this upstream
repository so that you can have everyone else's changes in your repo.
Note: There is no known way to do this in Android Studio; you need to use the terminal.

  $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/cdbbnnyCode/ftc_8813_master

See Section 4 for how to sync with the main repository.

2. Committing your code

    Committing your code is an important part of the Git workflow. When you commit a change, it is
saved in the repository and you can revert back to it (e.g. if you made a really nasty bug and don't
know why).

How to commit your code:

     Using Android Studio                            Using the terminal
1) Go to VCS --> Commit Changes                  $ git commit -m "descriptive commit message"
2) Make a descriptive commit message
3) Click 'Commit'

3. Pushing your code to GitHub

    Pushing your commits to your GitHub repository is also very important. Just about nothing in Git
is automatically synced, so this is the way to do it manually. Pushing your code will send the
changes to the GitHub repository so you can then submit a Pull Request to get your code merged into
the main repository (see Section 5).

How to push your code:

     Using Android Studio                            Using the terminal
You can actually commit AND push in the same   Note: You need to have already committed.
dialog box. To do that, just follow the above    $ git push
instructions for committing your changes,      You will need to enter your GitHub login password to
except in the popup menu when you hover over   continue.
the Commit button, select 'Commit and Push'.
Otherwise, go to VCS --> Git --> Push (or
press Ctrl+Shift+K)

Note: If the push fails, it may be because the GitHub repository has changes that weren't merged
into your local repository. Try pulling the changes into your local repository:

     Using Android Studio                              Using the terminal
1) Go to VCS --> Update Project                  $ git pull
2) Click OK

4. Updating from the upstream repository

You should do this about once or twice every day.

     Using Android Studio                              Using the terminal
1) Go to VCS --> Git --> Pull                    $ git pull upstream master
2) Change Remote to upstream
3) Click Pull

5. Adding your code to the upstream repository

    Once you've finished something you've been working on, you should get it added into the main
codebase.

1) Push your code to your repository if you haven't already (see Section 3)
2) Open a browser tab and go to
    https://github.com/cdbbnnyCode/ftc_8813_master
3) On the left, next to the 'Branch: master' button, there is a 'New pull request' button. Click it.
4) If the pull request page looks like this:
   _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
  |  _                                                                                                          /

  |[  [_base:_master_] ... [_compare:_master_]                                                                  \
  |~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~/

  Click on the 'Compare across forks' link. It should now look like this:

   _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________
  |  _                                                                                                          /

  | \_,(_)| | ||_)(_|| (-'  (_ | |(_|| |(_|(-'_)                                                                /
  |            |                         _|                                                                     \

  Make sure the base fork is my repository and the head fork is your repository. Then click on
'Create pull request'.

5) Notify me that you would like your code imported into the main repository. I will check your code
and then merge your changes.
